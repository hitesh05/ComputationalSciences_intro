SC has realised it seems. Are you worried other women's issues are being clubbed now?  ?    1949  #sabarimala
7   2019-11-14 11:05:58              Disappointing that the Supreme Court could not stand by its own verdict on #Sabarimala - as the matter gets referred to a larger bench. We cant be talking about a Uniform Civil Code if we still believe that menstruating women should keep away from some temples. Sorry. #WeTheWomen    5173  #sabarimala

16  2019-01-08 13:35:58                                    So when women want to enter #sabarimala, it is a fight for equality, and Kerala police will support them, but when women want to enter the Vavar mosque, it is a threat to law and order and the same Kerala police will arrest them?  following Odd-Even formula?    6503  #sabarimala
17  2019-01-06 18:04:42                     CPM which boasted of 5 million strong women wall for gender equality could not get even 100 women devotees to go Sabarimala. It stealthily smuggled in couple of atheist women into the temple thro side gate. This is shamelessly celebrated as victory by liberals  #Sabarimala    2836  #sabarimala
18  2019-01-05 18:09:54    Tuesday We are going to High court agnst Kerala CM &amp; DGP. The activists who enterd #Sabarimala publicly declared that they neither took 41days fasting nor r devotees. They says they only wantd to prove some feminist points. Govt &amp; DGP conspired wit them. Wont leave anybdy involvd      2114  #sabarimala

So why are they obsessed with #Sabarimala &amp; the temple traditions? Whose interest does the desecration serve? This is not a fight for gender equality. It‚Äôs bigotry    2435  #sabarimala

23  2019-01-01 18:45:13                            Thank you for speaking on this Shri  ji! Just to add to your point Sir, it is not merely a tradition,it is a core religious practice which is integral to the #Sabarimala Ayyappa Temple. So it's centrality to d identity of the Temple is more than that of a tradition.    2065  #sabarimala

The wall was useful. It fully exposed the panic &amp; hate, craftily hidden by certain people till now.      4077  #sabarimala

31  2018-11-17 02:02:07       As Kerala &amp; the world is sleeping, a small band of devotees r stuck at #Sabarimala, being harrassed by Police, denied all facilities &amp; getting arrested at midnight.

It is a Hindu temple, belonging to all the Hindus of India! And it is being recognised as such! Finally.    3093  #sabarimala

Guy in this picture was in uniform during brutal lathi charge against #Sabarimala devotees. Which camp this goon belongs to, CPM or SDPI?      2421  #sabarimala
58  2018-10-23 12:01:32            Meet my brother Prithvipal who led the fight at #sabarimala Sannidhanam. He is chairing Pandalam Dharmasasta Temple Advisory Committee.

61  2018-10-22 13:01:30            Women who attempted to enter #Sabarimala - Libi -Christian Suhasini Raj- Hindu hating #sickular.  Kavitha Jakkal -Christian.  Rehana Fatima -Muslim.

62  2018-10-21 15:20:14  30 million men visit #Sabarimala every year, after a period of austerity following celibacy, teetotalism &amp; vegetarianism. Pilgrims benefit a lot - peace, health, discipline &amp; detox. Unfortunate, Judiciary &amp; a few low-class activists attempting to disturb a great tradition/faith      5556  #sabarimala
63  2018-10-20 16:07:58                    The abode of Lord Ayyappa should be kept intact with utmost serenity, respecting tradition. It‚Äôs not a place for activism or one-upmanship.  I am sure, while considering the review petition, the Hon‚Äôble Court will take note of the sentiments of devotees as well. #Sabarimala   10748  #sabarimala
64  2018-10-20 10:38:58             That image is what Rehana Fathima put up as her Facebook cover. Those toasting her attempt to enter #Sabarimala should try sending Kurt Westergaard, maker of Prophet cartoons, to a mosque anywhere in the world and see what happens. Selectively kicking Hindus can‚Äôt be secularism.      4371  #sabarimala

67  2018-10-19 13:01:21           There r over 20 lakh temples in India out of which over 1000 r of Lord Ayappa where he may be in any of 4 phases of life- Shishu or Grihasth or Vanprasth &amp; here all women can enter. Only in #Sabarimala he is brahmachari-has certain rules for his self control-We should honour it.    2605  #sabarimala

It is a place of worship for the ones who believe in the deity and it‚Äôs traditions. Not a discotheque.    4932  #sabarimala
70  2018-10-19 08:00:34                       SC judges have waxed eloquent about how 'dissent is the safety valve of democracy'. Do they not see the sea of women out on the streets in #Kerala, peacefully protesting against the #Sabarimala verdict? Only Maoist hatred of India conspiracies qualifies as valid dissent?    4172  #sabarimala

If you do NOT believe in Ayyappa, why do you even want to go to #sabarimala?    6043  #sabarimala
72  2018-10-17 23:10:36                  #Sabarimala for the media now it is prestige battle. Just ego clash. From women's rights it has now become one or two or three women's rights Vs a million women's forbearance. Those women who go there it is just publicity stunt. No faith. No religion. Just to shame faithfuls.    5497  #sabarimala

If it's going to be insults and noise, never going back again.    1631  #sabarimala
74  2018-10-17 16:16:44                 It is sickening the way every commie libtard woman journo is making a beeline to #Sabarimala, like a wake of vultures that have smelt flesh! You provoke, you insult, you belittle, you snigger, you sneer at devout Hindus and then when they retaliate, you cry victim? #Sabarimala    4249  #sabarimala

It is believed that Lord Ayyappa, son of the Raja of Pandalam, gave tribals the right to protect the place    2286  #sabarimala

83  2018-09-28 11:26:59                   Fact is that out of 25 lakh HINDU temples, Only 6 temples don't allow men &amp; 5 temples don't allow women   but Irony is Muslim women in burqas who are denied entry in most of the the mosques are fighting for Hindu women's entry in 5 of the temples.
